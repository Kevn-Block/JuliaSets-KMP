### Demo!
https://kevn-block.github.io/JuliaSets-KMP/

ðŸš¨ Be aware, the WASM version is very slow! This app is best used on desktop (or until a shader is written) ðŸš¨

### Features
* Render predefined Julia Sets
* Animate slowly between them
* Scale in the set, showing off the infinite capability they have
* Change the color grading of the image

### Notes
* Run in release mode for the best performance
* Animating constants works best on a desktop with a smaller window
* There are known UI issues, such as extra recomposing
